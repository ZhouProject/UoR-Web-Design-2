## Introduction

- Welcome to Web Design 2. In this course we build on the practical creative programming skills and experience that we developed in Web Design 1 and apply them in new contexts. We expand our knowledge of specific programming languages and frameworks so that we can make better choices regarding user research, interface design, web development etc. that reflect creative requirements. We also continue to work with interactivity through programming in ways that are specifically useful in Web Design contexts.

- The course is divided into research block and programming block that focus on specific areas, exploring them in ways that relate to specific languages, platforms, frameworks and approaches. We will move fast, so you will need your wits about you. You are encouraged to take written notes, especially when you are working on your own to review material covered in class.
