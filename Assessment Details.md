# 1. Project Presentations - 20%
Students to present their project ideas demonstrating a good understanding of topics relating to research, design, and execution. 

### The presentation must include

- Website Pitch: Use the presentation to "pitch" their website, showcasing its features and highlighting how it meets the criteria for accessibility, ethics, and future developments.
- Research Process: Discuss the research process that was undertaken to create their website. This can include wireframing, usability research, information architecture maps, and other techniques used to determine the user's needs and how to best meet them. Explain the methods used to gather information and how it influenced the design and functionality of the website. Showcasing the research process will demonstrate the students' attention to detail and ability to create a well-designed user-centered website.
- Technical Implementation: Discuss the technical aspects of building their website, such as the development tools and platforms used, coding languages, and other technologies involved. Explain how they approached the technical challenges they encountered and how they overcame them.
- Analytics: Describe what metrics and tools will be used to monitor and track user behaviour and discuss how this will improve data-driven decision making. Explain how user-privacy plays a role into implementing analytics on the website.
- Ethical Responsibilities: Explain the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when creating a website, such as privacy, data protection, and intellectual property rights.
- Accessibility: Discuss the importance of making websites accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and the various techniques and tools that can be used to achieve this.
