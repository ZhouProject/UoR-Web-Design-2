# ReacJS

## [Installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial)
- You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager) installed.
  - Tip: To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type ```node --version``` and ```npm --version``` in a terminal or command prompt.
- Create a new folder, then open it with Terminal
- Create React project (replace ```my-app``` with your project name)
  
  ```npx create-react-app my-app```

- Run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and open the application in a browser:
  ```
  cd my-app
  npm start
  ```
- You should see the React logo and a link to "Learn React" on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with VS Code. (If your see ```Can't resolve 'web-vitals'```, try ```npm install web-vitals```

- To open your React application in VS Code, open another terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the my-app folder and type ```code .:```
  ```
  cd my-app
  code .
  ```

## JSX
- stands for JavaScript XML, allowing us to write HTML in React.
